# Credit Approval Analysis and Risk Prediction Based on Machine Learning



Project Explanation: 
  
  - In this system, some machine learning algorithms are used and compared each other with the aid of suitable test and training dataset.
  - In this way, algorithms are choose in order to ensure high accuracy in prediction. Machine learning tool which is called WEKA is used for this project.
  - There are also datasets such that training and test using cross validation method so that the computer teaches these datasets and makes a decision about the related problems.
  - Dataset is analysed with the statistical results using R script language.
  - In order to realize web service, Azure Machine Learning Tool and MVC technologies are used.
  - In this way, a machine learning model is designed in Azure Machine Learning Tool.
  - This design are modelled in terms of WEKA and R script language results.
  - When the customer’s information are entered in form application, system requests to machine learning and then response a message from machine learning tool whether customer’s credit approval are risky or not.
  - All details are documented as above source code section which is called "Credit_Approval_Analysis" as pdf.
  
 Project Aim:
 
  - Increasing the accuracy of credit approval evaluation.
  - Reduce the necessity for human intervention to decision process.
  - Speed up the banks' credit approval processes.
  
  Problem Setup:
  
  - Bank's history of previous credit results. (paid back or not).
  - Customer's information
    - Demographic information(age.sex,wealth)
    - Previous credit history
    - Current account information
    - Etc.
